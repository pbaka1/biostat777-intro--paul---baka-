# About :

I am a medical doctor from Ghana and an MPH candidate at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. My long-term ambition is to become a **pediatric oncologist**, improving outcomes for children with cancer through research and equitable care delivery. As part of my MPH journey, I’m taking advanced coursework in **statistical programming paradigms and workflows** and building strong **R** skills for data analysis, which I see as essential for modern, precision-medicine research.

**Research interests**

\- **Pediatric hematologic cancers**:novel genetic sequencing approaches and translational pipelines.

\- **Precision medicine & big data**:reproducible analytics, rigorous inference, and clinically meaningful endpoints.  

\- **Equity**: ensuring innovations reach children in low-resource settings.

**Technical toolbox**

\- **R** (tidyverse, visualization, data wrangling)  

\- **Reproducible workflows** (Quarto, literate programming)  

\- **Intro methods for genomics/biostatistics**; growing skills in modeling and data engineering
